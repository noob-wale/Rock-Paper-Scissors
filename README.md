# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# How Does The Game Work.
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game where 2 players always start every round by saying, "rock, paper, scissors:shoot" And on 'Shoot' each player holds out their fist(rock), flat hand(paper) or index and middle finger(scissors). Rock crushes scissors- Rock wins. Scissors cuts Papers - Scissors wins. Paper covers rock - Paper win. If players draw the same, its a draw and they repeat.

# Writing the algorithm - pseudocode

If player selects rock and computer selects scissors then print rock wins
Else if both selects rock then print its a draw
If player selects scissors and computer selects paper then print scissors wins
Else if both selects scissors then print its a draw
If player selects paper and computer selects rock then print paper wins
Else if both selects paper then print its a draw


# Algorithm breakdown

I wrote the function to randomly choose from and array and return a choice. ANd then getting the choice form the array as a string. I used the inbuilt Javascript methods to create the computer random choice.

I used the If-Else method to create the function that returns win or lose against the computer. I then used the for loops to make it play 5 times,
