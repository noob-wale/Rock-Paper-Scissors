# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# How Does The Game Work.
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game where 2 players always start every round by saying, "rock, paper, scissors:shoot" And on 'Shoot' each player holds out their fist(rock), flat hand(paper) or index and middle finger(scissors). Rock crushes scissors- Rock wins. Scissors cuts Papers - Scissors wins. Paper covers rock - Paper win. If players draw the same, its a draw and they repeat.
